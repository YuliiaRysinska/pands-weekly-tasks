# Bank account numbers can stored as 10 character strings, for security reasons some applications only display the last 4 characters (with the other other characters replaced with Xs).
# Prog that reads in a 10 character account number and outputs the account number with only the last 4 digits showing 
#(and the first 6 digits replaced with Xs).

# bank_ac = input("Please enter an 10 digit account number:")ce[-4:0] = "X")
